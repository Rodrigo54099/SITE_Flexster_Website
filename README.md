### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics we discussed in our labs did prepare me for completeing the assignment. I did not have any experice at all with API's and Lab3 in specific really helped me get a good Understanding of what they are and how they work. It was a bit dificult to understand them at first, which made me feel nervous about the first weekly assignment, but through patience and practice, I was able to complete the weekly assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have definitely continued to implement a strech feature. I was attempting to implement the popup feature but I did not have enough time to fully implement it. I would have also added more styling elements to my website

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I really liked demoing my project because I was able to show how much I've learned thus far. I also really liked looking at my peers' projects and seeing what they were able to make. I will definitely implement some features like a slider or a popup box next time now that I have a very solid understanding of how js, html, and css work.
